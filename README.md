# Microsoft Certification Resources
Resources and tips for achieving Microsoft Certifications

## Resources
MS Learn is probably the primary place to learn: It has a clear structure, divided into easily consumed modules. Do use the structure, but be prepared to go outside to learn more about the specific subject in each module: MS Learn has the right *structure* but does not have all the *content* (though it often links to it). 

### Mock exams
We have looked at a few, from Udemy, Pluralsight and the "official" one that Microsoft links to. They are all pretty poor, in our experience, often being outdated. That said, it can help to at least get a feel for what the exam will be like - just don't rely on it to cover all the areas.

## Studying
1. Not everything is covered by MS Learn. Do follow the MS Learn structure, but be prepared to learn more about the specific things that are listed in there. For example, if there is a module about APIM and you have never used that - do spend a bit of extra time learning a bit more about APIM than what is strictly included in MS Learn.
2. Try to memorize numbers for things like SLAs, retention periods etc: Some of the questions will say things like "a requirement is for messages to be retained for 24 hours" and this is a clue to help you determine which service to use - so you need to be able to remember which message service(s) retain messages for 24 hours. You can often sense that a number is important from the way it is emphasised in MS Learn. **Should we try to build a list of those kind of things from the training materials to share and practice on?**.
3. Try to memorize specific commands and sections in yaml/cli/powershell/application manifests/APIM policies/C# code. Some of the exam questions will ask you to re-organise certain commands or configuration file sections and it is important that you know the correct name as sometimes they will try to catch you out. CLI/PowerShell you can usually work out - assuming you use them regularly - but things like APIM Policies and, in particular, Application Manifests (for App Registrations in AD) can be a challenge.

## Online exam tips
1. Re-run the "system test" immediately before check in. The exam software will only check for "illegal processes" *after* checkin: It will allow you to kill some processes (like winvnc) but some processes (like srsrvice.exe) will cause you to be kicked out and you then have to go through the whole check-in process again and sit in the queue again.
2. Be prepared for a loooong wait time in checkin: A proctor has to manually check your pictures and ID and may need to call you. Sometimes there aren't enough proctors for the number of people booked. Book an hour beyond your expected end time to avoid having to rush the exame.
3. Clear *everything* away from your desk, including coasters.
4. Remember the "scenario" questions / the multiple sections. Some exams will ask you a series of questions and then allow you to review them, before they move on to the next section and ask you more questions. If you go back and review the questions in the first section you may not have enough time to do the next section(s). **I am not sure if you get the chance to review the questions from section 1, if you go through to section 2? I think so, but not sure.**
